#AutoClonePatterns.xrnx#

This is a plugin to be used with [renoise](www.renoise.com), a digital audio workstation based on mod trackers, that has a nice lua API. 
This script overrides the looping feature of the pattern matrix. If a pattern in the loop is being recorded over and the edit cursor is set to "follow playback", it will clone the loop sequence in the pattern matrix. It's useful to jam over a sequence. Just select the loop you want to record on, and your whole performance will be recorded. The tool can be enabled or disabled via the Tools menu or via keybinding.  
You can download a package ready for being drag and dropped into Renoise in [the tools section](http://tools.renoise.com/tools/auto-clone-patterns) of their website.  
The idea for this tool came from Conner_Bw on [this thread](http://www.renoise.com/board/index.php?/topic/26968-idearequest-auto-add-pattern-for-recording/) in the Renoise forum.
